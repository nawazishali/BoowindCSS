# Introduction

A set of Bootstrap Components built with TailwindCSS to kickstart your next Tailwind Project. These are HTML components aiming to help people coming from bootstrap backgroud to easily adopt TailwindCSS in their next project.

This project tries to use semantic HTML like `<dialog>` & `<detials>` wherever possible to keep things simple and inline with WAI-ARIA guidelines.

<span class="flex flex-row items-center justify-center gap-4 my-12 md:gap-10">
  <img src="/bootstrap-4.svg" class="inline w-16 md:w-32" alt="bootstrap-4"/> <span class="text-3xl text-gray-700 md:text-6xl">+</span>
  <img src="/tailwindcss.svg" class="inline w-16 md:w-32" alt="tailwindcss"/> <span class="text-3xl text-gray-700 md:text-6xl">=</span>
  <img src="/boowindcss.svg" class="inline w-16 md:w-32" alt="boowindcss"/> 
</span>

### Note:

This is a work in progress so you might not find all components yet along with some missing steps in the usage guide. In the coming days I will be setting up a roadmap and create issues accordingly to track progress.
